# Park Washroom Facilities

## Overview

This paper investigates the distribution and accessibility of public washroom facilities in Toronto, highlighting their significant role in urban planning. Our analysis reveals disparities in access, with certain neighborhoods lacking sufficient facilities. This finding underscores the need for improved infrastructure to support public health and inclusivity in urban environments. By addressing these gaps, we can enhance the overall quality of life for residents and visitors, making cities more accommodating for all.

## Statement on LLM usage

In preparing this paper, I utilized a large language model (LLM) to assist in drafting and refining text, particularly for generating discussion points and organizing content. The LLM provided insights on structuring arguments and improving clarity. However, all content was carefully reviewed and modified to ensure it aligns with the paper's objectives and maintains academic integrity. No direct outputs from the LLM were used without revision.
